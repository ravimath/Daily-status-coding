# Program1
Write a C Program to Reverse a Linked List in groups of given size.
Test Case 1:
If a linked listis: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8
The value of size k is 2
Then the linked list looks like: 2 → 1 → 4 → 3 → 6 → 5 → 8 → 7

Test Case 2:
If a linked listis: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8
The value of size k is 3
Then the linked list looks like: 3 → 2 → 1 → 6 → 5 → 4 → 8 → 7
