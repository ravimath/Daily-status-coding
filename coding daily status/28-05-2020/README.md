A digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number. Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. This is only applicable to the natural numbers.
# Pro2
Write a function that accepts a string consisting entiring of brackets ({}) and returns whether it is balanced. Every "opening" bracket must be followed by a closing bracket of the same type. There can also be nested brackets, which adhere to the same rule.

The rules for reducing the array are:
#The first and last element say X and Y are chosen and removed from the array arr[].
#The values X and Y are added. Z = X + Y.
#Insert the value of Z % K into the array arr[] at the position ((N/2) + 1)th position, where N denotes the current length of the array.
