# Pro1
Take a string as input and find the number of uppercase and lower case letters in the string and print the count.
# Pro2
We are given 3 strings: str1, str2, and str3. Str3 is said to be a shuffle of str1 and str2 if it can be formed by interleaving the characters of str1 and str2 in a way that maintains the left to right ordering of the characters from each string. For example, given str1="abc" and str2="def", str3="dabecf" is a valid shuffle since it preserves the character ordering of the two strings. So, given these 3 strings write a function that detects whether str3 is a valid shuffle of str1 and str2.
# Pro3
Write a c program to solve a system of linear congruences by applying the Chinese Remainder Theorem.
# Pro4
Write a Java Program to check whether the given number is Armstrong number or not.
# Pro5
Write a Java Program to find longest substring without repeating characters in a string.
